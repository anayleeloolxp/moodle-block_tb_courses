Add multiple responsive Sliding Courses lists to your home page, blog, dashboard or static pages

Manage all settings in a single page, right from your Leeloo LXP theme back end

### Quickly and easily show courses and events dynamically, including:

* Available courses and/or events
* Featured courses and/or events
* In Progress courses and/or events
* Completed courses and/or events
* Upcoming courses and/or events
* My courses and/or events

## How does it work?
1. You can add as many blocks as you want, in as many pages as you need. In the context of any page, you can show/hide any number of blocks. This feature makes it extremely versatile, to display the courses that you want on any page within your platform.

2. The Courses Multi-List includes four different styles:
    * Light and Dark
    * Embedded image yes/no
        Combinations
        * Light
        * Dark
        * Light with embedded image
        * Dark with embedded image

    You can easily differentiate between pairs of courses, according to your model.
    For examples, you could display courses using with the light style and events with the dark style.
    Or regular courses with embedded image and light, and premium courses with embedded image and dark; or free and paid courses.





All the settings, images, titles and content are easily managed from your Leeloo LXP back end, under Leeloo LXP theme.
   




## Featured courses / events

Featured courses allows you to select specific courses from your offering and feature them on any page: home page, dashboard, user profile or any static page. You can even add it on a course page, to promote and showcase upcoming courses to your existing students.

You may want to showcase a course taught by an outstanding instructor or influencer. Or date sensitive courses. Or maybe a free course.

You can create several sections and name them according to your needs; and you can use both the style and the embed images in the background features to differentiate among the sections.

### Options:
* Section title: the title of this section, visible to the users
* Section type: select “Featured”
* Select Featured courses: choose the courses that you want to showcase
* Category Id: you might also add a category id, to showcase the courses within this category
* Default maximum courses: choose the maximum number of courses that will be displayed
* Style: select Light or Dark style, to visually differentiate Featured sections
* View as: choose between Grid Slider with autoslide (on/off), Grid or List
* Default course image: the image that will be shown by default if your course doesn’t have any
* Embed images into background: use in tandem with the style, to visually set sections apart
* Summary character limit: maximum number of characters that will be shown in the box
* Show teachers: display the teachers pictures as an overlay on the course image
* Course progress bar: display the student’s progress in the box, as a bar with percentage




## Available courses / events
Available courses / events allows you to dynamically showcase the courses in which the logged in user is not enrolled in. You can feature them on any page: home page, dashboard, user profile or any static page. You can also add it to a course page, to promote and feature available courses and events to your students.

You can create several sections and name them according to your needs; and you can use both the style and the embed images in the background features to differentiate among the sections.

### Options:
* Section title: the title of this section, visible to the users
* Section type: select “Available”
* Category Id: you can choose a category id, to showcase only the courses within this category
* Default maximum courses: choose the maximum number of courses that will be displayed
* Style: select Light or Dark style, to visually differentiate Featured sections
* View as: choose between Grid Slider with autoslide (on/off), Grid or List
* Default course image: the image that will be shown by default if your course doesn’t have any

* Summary character limit: maximum number of characters that will be shown in the box
* Show teachers: display the teachers pictures as an overlay on the course image
* Course progress bar: display the student’s progress in the box, as a bar with percentage





## Learners sections
Now, let’s add the learners courses, based on their progress.

* The Completed courses are the ones that the learner has finished
* In progress are the ones with progress between 1 and 99%
* And upcoming are the ones they are enrolled in, with zero percent progress
* My courses are simply all courses they are enrolled in, regardless of their progress

Use this in combination with the category id and the styles to refine the results!

### Options:
The options for these sections are the same as the Available Courses / Events.
You simply need to choose the type of section you want to create from the Type dropdown:



To see the result, we need to log in as a student. Mary is enrolled in several courses, some are completed, others are upcoming and others in progress. She can see this customized summary right on your home page, her dashboard, her profile, any static page or any course page.



## Add anywhere!
One great feature of the COURSES MULTI-LIST sections is that we can use it in all the pages that we want, just by adding the courses block in Moodle. And we can show or hide sections right from the block!

This way we can create dozens of sections in Leeloo LXP, and show some of them in the home page, others in the dashboard, others on the course pages, and others in any number of static pages!

For example, let’s do that with a static page in a few seconds.
* Create a static page and name it “Courses and Events”
* Add the Courses block



* Configure the block in Moodle  



* Select the Featured Courses, the Available Courses and the Available Events sections from the list:



* And voilà!

Now you could create additional sections for any type of courses or events, from a category or from a list.
